# Optical-Wing-Simulation
A simulation of the lift and drag coefficients on a transparent semi-cylinder due to radiation pressure. I made a ray tracing engine in
Wolfram Mathematica that computes the force that light exerts on convex surfaces. 

I did this for my undergraduate thesis in physics at Reed College.
